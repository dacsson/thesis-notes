## The Gist of It 

It was suggested that we somehow *prove* that a sequence of instructions/program before optimization and after is equivalent.

Now, we can do it by *fuzzing* or *logically* using SMT solvers, maybe there is a combined approach.

But first I need to understand the state of the art for this kind of proves.

## Tools to review 
- [[Vellvm]]
- YARPGen
- MopFuzzer
- [[CompCert]]
- [[Alive2]]
## Ideas
- Translation of RISC-V asm to \*.smt2 with proof afterwords
- Vellvm, but semantics is RISC-V (using riscv-sail-model) instead of LLVM-IR
