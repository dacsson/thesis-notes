[[Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers.pdf]]

## Why is this interesting?

Worked as a good demo to me about compiler verification importance.
## Gist

Generated a big big suite of C programs for compiler testing found neumerous bugs in GCC, LLVM, etc. and 0 bugs in CompCert - verified C compiler.

> The apparent unbreakability of CompCert supports a strong
argument that developing compiler optimizations within a proof
framework, where safety checks are explicit and machine-checked,
has tangible benefits for compiler users.
