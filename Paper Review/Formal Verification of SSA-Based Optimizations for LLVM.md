# Abstract

Optimization seems to be very error prone. Modern compilers use SSA IR a lot, but verifying it is hard, because the dependency on function control-flow graph. *"This paper addresses this challenge by developing a proof technique for proving SSA-based program invariants and compiler optimizations. "* using their framework Vellvm (Coq-based LLVM-IR semantics)
